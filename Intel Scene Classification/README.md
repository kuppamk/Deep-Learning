Intel Scene Classification

How do we, humans, recognize a forest as a forest or a mountain as a mountain? We are very good at categorizing scenes based on the semantic representation and object affinity, but we know very little about the processing and encoding of natural scene categories in the human brain. 
We are provided with a dataset of ~25k images from a wide range of natural scenes from all around the world. Your task is to identify which kind of scene can the image be categorized into.
